          Terms and Conditions (T&C) for Founders
        </h1>
        <p>
          1) You cannot raise more than $20,000 in the first round of funding.
        </p>
        <p>2) You must share updates on your raised funds on a weekly basis.</p>
        <p>
          3) If you raise $10,000 in a one-month period, you are required to
          repay $2,500 every week.
        </p>
        <p>
          4) You must share your Profit and Loss (P&L) balance sheet every week.
          Failure to do so will result in a $1,000 penalty per week.
        </p>
        <p>
          5) 10% of your raised amount will be deducted as a service fee. <br />
          For example, if you raise $100,000, you will receive $90,000 after
          deducting the $10,000 service fee. <br />
          However, you are still required to repay the full $100,000 (100%) to
          your investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          6) You must offer at least 5% profit-sharing or more to investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          7) Once funding is completed, projects and uploaded media cannot be
          edited or removed from the site.
        </p>
        <p>8) Projects cannot raise funds for charitable purposes.</p>
        <p>
          9) Funding is all-or-nothingâ€”you will either receive the full amount
          or nothing at all. Make sure to calculate your investment requirements
          carefully.
