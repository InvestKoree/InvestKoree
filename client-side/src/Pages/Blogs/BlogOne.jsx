        How to Find the Right Investor for Your Business
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Securing the right investment can be a game-changer for your business.
        But with so many potential investors out there, how do you choose the
        one who truly aligns with your goals? At <strong>InvestKoree</strong>,
        we understand that finding the right investor is not just about getting
        money—it’s about finding a partner who believes in your vision and can
        help take your business to the next level.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        Why the Right Investor Matters
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        When seeking investors, it’s easy to focus on the amount of money they
        can provide. However, the right investor offers much more than just
        capital. They bring expertise, resources, and connections that can
        accelerate your growth. A good investor will be passionate about your
        business and share your long-term vision, supporting you through
        challenges and celebrating milestones along the way.

        Key Traits to Look for in an Investor
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">
        1. Industry Knowledge and Experience
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Investors with a deep understanding of your industry can offer valuable
        insights and guidance. Whether it’s navigating market trends or handling
        business challenges, their experience can help steer you in the right
        direction.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. Shared Vision and Goals</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        It’s crucial that your investor understands your business vision and
        shares similar goals. You don’t just want someone who invests in your
        business—they should be excited about its future and committed to seeing
        it grow.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">
        3. Strong Network and Resources
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        A good investor isn’t just a source of funding—they can also open doors
        to new opportunities. Look for investors with a strong network of
        contacts that can help grow your business, from potential partners to
        key industry players.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4. Long-Term Support</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The right investor will be invested in your business long-term. They’ll
        understand that success takes time and be patient with your business’s
        growth trajectory.
